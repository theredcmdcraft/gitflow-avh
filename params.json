{"body":"# git-flow\r\n\r\nA collection of Git extensions to provide high-level repository operations\r\nfor Vincent Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/git-model \"original\r\nblog post\"). This fork adds functionality not added to the original branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\nFor the best introduction to get started with `git flow`, please read Jeff\r\nKreeftmeijer's blog post:\r\n\r\n[http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/](http://jeffkreeftmeijer.com/2010/why-arent-you-using-git-flow/)\r\n\r\nOr have a look at one of these screen casts:\r\n\r\n* [How to use a scalable Git branching model called git-flow](http://buildamodule.com/video/change-management-and-version-control-deploying-releases-features-and-fixes-with-git-how-to-use-a-scalable-git-branching-model-called-gitflow) (by Build a Module)\r\n* [A short introduction to git-flow](http://vimeo.com/16018419) (by Mark Derricutt)\r\n* [On the path with git-flow](http://codesherpas.com/screencasts/on_the_path_gitflow.mov) (by Dave Bock)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installing git-flow\r\n\r\nSee the Wiki for up-to-date [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki/Installation).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Integration with your shell\r\n\r\nFor those who use the [Bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or\r\n[ZSH](http://www.zsh.org) shell, please check out the excellent work on the\r\n[git-flow-completion](http://github.com/bobthecow/git-flow-completion) project\r\nby [bobthecow](http://github.com/bobthecow). It offers tab-completion for all\r\ngit-flow subcommands and branch names.\r\n\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n* See the [FAQ](http://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/wiki/FAQ) section\r\nof the project Wiki.\r\n* Version Numbering Scheme.  \r\nStarting with version 1.0, the project uses the following scheme:\r\n\\<MAJOR\\>.\\<MINOR\\>.\\<REVISION\\>-avh\r\n\r\n## Please help out\r\n\r\nThis project is still under development. Feedback and suggestions are very\r\nwelcome and I encourage you to use the [Issues\r\nlist](http://github.com/petervanderdoes/gitflow/issues) on Github to provide that\r\nfeedback.\r\n\r\nFeel free to fork this repo and to commit your additions. For a list of all\r\ncontributors, please see the [AUTHORS](AUTHORS) file.\r\n\r\nAny questions, tips, or general discussion can be posted to our Google group:\r\n[http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users](http://groups.google.com/group/gitflow-users)\r\nThis is the original group set up to support the nvie branch, but I am monitoring\r\nthe list as well for any questions related to my version.\r\nWhen you do post a question on the list please indicate which version you are,\r\nusing the complete version number.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nFork the repository.  Then, run:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit clone git@github.com:<username>/gitflow.git\r\ncd gitflow\r\n```\r\nInstall the git-flow software by running make.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit flow init -d\r\ngit flow feature start <your feature>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, do work and commit your changes.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ngit flow feature publish <your feature>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen done, open a pull request to your feature branch.\r\n\r\n## License terms\r\n\r\ngit-flow is published under the FreeBSD License, see the\r\n[LICENSE](LICENSE) file. Although the FreeBSD License does not require you to\r\nshare any modifications you make to the source code, you are very much\r\nencouraged and invited to contribute back your modifications to the community,\r\npreferably in a Github fork, of course.\r\n\r\n\r\n## git flow usage\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\nTo initialize a new repo with the basic branch structure, use:\r\n\r\n\t\tgit flow init [-d]\r\n\r\nThis will then interactively prompt you with some questions on which branches\r\nyou would like to use as development and production branches, and how you\r\nwould like your prefixes be named. You may simply press Return on any of\r\nthose questions to accept the (sane) default suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe ``-d`` flag will accept all defaults.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating feature/release/hotfix/support branches\r\n\r\n* To list/start/finish/delete feature branches, use:\r\n\r\n  \t\tgit flow feature\r\n  \t\tgit flow feature start <name> [<base>]\r\n  \t\tgit flow feature finish <name>\r\n  \t\tgit flow feature delete <name>\r\n\r\n  For feature branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.\r\n\r\n* To push/pull a feature branch to the remote repository, use:\r\n\r\n  \t\tgit flow feature publish <name>\r\n\t\tgit flow feature pull <remote> <name>\r\n\r\n* To list/start/finish/delete release branches, use:\r\n\r\n  \t\tgit flow release\r\n  \t\tgit flow release start <release> [<base>]\r\n  \t\tgit flow release finish <release>\r\n  \t\tgit flow release delete <release>\r\n\r\n  For release branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `develop`.\r\n\r\n* To list/start/finish/delete hotfix branches, use:\r\n\r\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix\r\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix start <release> [<base>]\r\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix finish <release>\r\n  \t\tgit flow hotfix delete <release>\r\n\r\n  For hotfix branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.\r\n\r\n* To list/start support branches, use:\r\n\r\n  \t\tgit flow support\r\n  \t\tgit flow support start <release> <base>\r\n\r\n  For support branches, the `<base>` arg must be a commit on `master`.\r\n\r\n### Using Hooks and Filters\r\n\r\nFor a wide variety of commands hooks or filters can called before and after\r\nthe command.  \r\nThe files should be placed in .git/hooks  \r\nIn the directory hooks you can find examples of all the hooks available.\r\n\r\n## Showing your appreciation\r\n\r\nOf course, the best way to show your appreciation for the git-flow tool itself\r\nremains contributing to the community.
