# What is git-flow AVH Edition
git-flow AVH Edition is a collection of Git extensions to provide high-level 
repository operations for Vincent Driessen's [branching model]http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  
The AVH Edition adds more functionality to the existing git-flow and several of 
the internal commands have been rewritten to speed up the software.
